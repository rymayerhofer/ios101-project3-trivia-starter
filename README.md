## Notes

I knew most of what I needed to do but I had issues caused by spelling the view controller in main wrong that took me over an hour to diagnose. 
Outside of that, it went pretty smooth. 
I turned it in late because it didn't show up on the Canvas calendar. I did all of the optional funtions (and added color feedback) so please forgive me.
